/**
 * 13. Roman to Integer
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
 */

/**
 * Solution:
 * Roman has a feature that about the last second number of 5 or 10, it's smaller append larger number, otherwise, it's larger number append multiple smaller or equal number, so we parse the roman from end to start
 * 1. Need a dictionary to represent different level of roman (multiple by 5), for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, every roman is combine with several roman from these tagged romans
 * 2. loop from end of s to front
 *      1. when current roman is larger than pre one (next roman), means it's a number except 5, 10, increase the current number
 *      2. when current roman is smaller than pre one, like "IV" 4, "IX" 9, means we decrease pre number 5, 10 by current roman 1 to 4, 9
 * 3. When met the next level number, repeat step 2
 * 4. got final integer and return, not necessary to * 10 + % 10, due to different roman represent already enough bits of 0s [1, 10, 100, 1000]
 *
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1) constant space for map
