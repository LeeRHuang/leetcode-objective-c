/**
 * 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
 * Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
 
 For example,
 Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
 
 Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

 * Solution 1: Iterative
 * exchange each pair of node, and goto next.next step
 *      1. keep control of the pre node and next node of current pair of nodes
 *      2. make sure next is not null and next.next is not null, and connect with next.next node
 *          1. if next is null, even number of pairs, stop
 *          2. if next is not null but next.next is null, odd number of pairs, just connect with the last node and stop
