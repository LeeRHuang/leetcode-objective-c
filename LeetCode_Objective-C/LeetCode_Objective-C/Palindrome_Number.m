 * 9. Palindrome Number
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
 */

/**
 * Solution:
 * Base case:
 *      1. cannot use parse to String, due to no extra space
 *      2. cannot revert all the integer due to may overflow
 *      3. be aware of if negative number
 * Revert at most half of integer to compare new generated integer with rest of origin integer
