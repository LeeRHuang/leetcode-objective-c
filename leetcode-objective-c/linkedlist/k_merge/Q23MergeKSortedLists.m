/**
 * 23. Merge k Sorted Lists
 * Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.
 */

/*
 * Solution 1: Binary reduction
 * treat these lists as an array, and do merge sort about this array, merge each two lists together
 * When not consider the I/O speed, this should be the one of the fastest way
 * When consider about I/O, each time when merge two lists, need to read these two lists from memory, the actual time is more slower than a merge sort
 * Theoretically time: n represent the length of lists array, m represent the average length of list, O(nlogn * 2m) = O(mnlogn)
 * If each step, merge two list to one list, it's the same as iteration, the time is O(2mn) = O(mn) ***not consider I/O performance***
 * Space: O(logn)
 */

/*
 * Solution 2: iteration
 * merge list from the first to the end
 * Same I/O performance issue as the binary reduction
 * Time: n represent the length of lists array, m represent the average length of list, O(mn) ***not consider I/O performance***
 * Space: O(1)

/*
 * Solution 3: Priority queue
 * push all list node into queue (merge to a dummy node at the same time)
 * Time: O(mnlogn) logn is the sort in a heap for n nodes at one time in the heap (each time need to poll a node and push a new one into it, max n nodes)
