/**
 * 528. Random Pick with Weight
 * Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= w.length <= 10000
 * 1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
 * pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * ["Solution","pickIndex"]
 * [[[1]],[]]
 * Output: [null,0]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * ["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
 * [[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
 * Explanation of Input Syntax:
 *
 * The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

/*
 Solution:
 
 random pick happened by weight which means if random number between two adjacent weight, then pick the new index,
 e.g.:
 [2, 4] which means when random between 1-2 pick index 0, when between 3-(4 + 2) pick index 1
 
 use presum array add weights so that could quickly do a binary search in weights presum array
